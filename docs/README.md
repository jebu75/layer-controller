### Layer Controller Docs

Obviously in progress...

#### LayerController Class

#### Layer Controls

Each layer type has its own control, which is created by and contained within a LayerController.

#### Application Layers

Application layers are graphics layers for use with custom result, measure, draw and other modules in the application. Application layers can be added with a layer control or assigned to be on top or bottom of the vector layers stack (without a control) with operational vector layers sandwiched in between. Top and bottom application layers are not affected by layer reordering.

#### Components

Components are essentially menu items with added functionality, which are added to the layer menu for setting layer transparency, layer scales, and the like.
